1. Tell us about yourself!
Import your LinkedIn profile so we can get a sense of your experience and skills. From extracting relevant skills to highlighting your most impactful achievements, we ensure your LinkedIn profile and cover letter work in perfect harmony to showcase the best professional version of you.

2. Choose your job
With Cover Companion, jobs aren't choosing you — you're choosing the job. Imprort the job description from LinkedIn, or provide us with the details directly. We use information about the company and role to tailor the perfect cover letter for you.

3. Provide some examples
We'll ask you to provide some examples of cover letters you've written before to get a sense of your tone and style. Other AI cover letters sound robotic and generic, but we learn your unique voice and use it to craft a custom cover letter that truly stands out.

4. Generate your cover letter!
We use the information you provide to generate a custom cover letter that's tailored to your skills, experience, and the job you're applying to. We use the latest AI technology to ensure that your cover letter is both professional and personalized to your unique voice. 

5. Review and download
We'll give you a chance to review your cover letter and make any final edits. Once you're satisfied, you can download your cover letter in Word format and use it to apply to your dream job! We have a wide selection of over 25 professional layouts, or you can import your own custom layout.
