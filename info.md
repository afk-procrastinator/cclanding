# FAQ

## Am I missing out if I don't use AI? 
Simply put, yes.  Recent surveys show that about 45% of job seekers use AI to improve their resumes(https://tech.co/news/half-job-seekers-using-ai), and nearly 40%(https://americanstaffing.net/posts/2023/09/07/ai-recruiting-tools/) use AI tools when applying for jobs. AI tools allow you to apply to more jobs in less time, without losing the personal touch that makes your application stand out. The worst thing you can do is not use AI, because your competitors likely are. Sorry. 

## Who is this for? 
This is for anyone who is currently applying to jobs, or planning to soon. Our algorithm is designed to be flexible and customizable — whether you're applying to jobs in Silicon Valley, D.C., or New York; a new grad or a seasoned professional; a software engineer or a lawyer; a cover letter for a tech job or a cover letter for a law job — we've got you covered. 

## How did you make this? 
The app's frontend uses Bubble.io, and the backend uses a custom-build API running FastAPI. This webpage was made with Next.js, with lots of help from Cursor and v0.dev. Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Sonnet models powers the AI, combined with tomquirk's linkedin-api library. 

## Why use AI to write cover letters? 
AI-powered cover letter writing offers several advantages:
- Time-saving: AI can generate a first draft quickly, allowing you to focus on personalization and refinement rather than starting from scratch.
- Consistency: AI ensures that your cover letter maintains a professional tone and structure, hitting all the key points employers look for.
- Personalization at scale: Our AI learns your writing style and adapts to each job application, allowing you to create tailored cover letters efficiently, even when applying to multiple positions.
- Up-to-date best practices: Our AI is constantly updated with the latest trends in cover letter writing, ensuring your application aligns with current industry standards.
- Overcoming writer's block: AI can provide a starting point, helping you overcome the initial hurdle of putting your thoughts on paper.
- Language enhancement: For non-native speakers or those less confident in their writing skills, AI can help improve language use and grammar.
- Integration with your profile: Our AI uses data from your LinkedIn profile to ensure your cover letter accurately reflects your experience and skills.
- Continuous improvement: The AI learns from user feedback, constantly refining its output to better meet job seekers' needs.

## How did you decide your pricing model? 
Our model is not cheap to run, and neither are hosting costs! Cover letters shake out to be around $1 each for users, but this drops much lower with volume. We think the subscription model is annoying — plus, your job search might last a week, month, or a year. We don't want your first paycheck to go to us! 

## So... who are you? 
I'm Spencer, a recent college graduate! I built this to help me and my friends get jobs, and now it's helping other people get jobs too. I'm not a real software engineer (I studied law and linguistics), but I just know enough to be dangerous.
